> Since 2025-10-01 [JetBrains DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) database management IDE is free for non-commercial use!  
> You may give it a try. It [scores](https://www.g2.com/compare/dbeaver-vs-datagrip) a bit higher than [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

## Please remember this till the end of your professional life
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **string literals** are enclosed in **single quotes**
> - **quoted identifiers** are enclosed in **double quotes**
> - boolean **equals** operator is `=`, not `==`
