### Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

The procedure used to execute RPN using a [stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) is as follows:
- Expressions are executed left to right;
- Each time a number or operand is read, we push it to the stack;
- Each time an operator comes up, we pop the required operands from the stack, perform the operations, and push the result back to the stack;
- Finished when there are no tokens (numbers, operators, or any other mathematical symbol) to read. The final number on the stack is the result.

### The [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)

To build the algorithm, we will need
- 1 stack for operations;
- 1 queue of the output;
- 1 list of tokens.

A pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:
```
 1. While there are tokens to be read:
 2.   Read a token
 3.   If it's a number add it to queue
 4.   If it's an operator
 5.     While there's an operator on the top of the stack with greater precedence:
 6.       Pop operators from the stack onto the output queue
 7.     Push the current operator onto the stack
 8.   If it's a left bracket push it onto the stack
 9.   If it's a right bracket 
10.     While there's not a left bracket at the top of the stack:
11.       Pop operators from the stack onto the output queue.
12.     Pop the left bracket from the stack and discard it
13. While there are operators on the stack, pop them to the queue
```
