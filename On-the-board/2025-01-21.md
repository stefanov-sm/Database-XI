#### Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)

The procedure used to execute RPN using a [stack machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) is as follows:
- Expressions are executed left to right;
- Each time a number or operand is read, we push it to the stack;
- Each time an operator comes up, we pop the required operands from the stack, perform the operations, and push the result back to the stack;
- Finished when there are no tokens (numbers, operators, or any other mathematical symbol) to read. The final number on the stack is the result.

#### The [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) by [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)

Parses infix expressions into RPN

A pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:
```
 While there are tokens to be read:
   Read a token
   If it's a value pass it to the output
   If it's an operator:
     While there's an operator on the top of the stack with higher precedence:
       Pop operators from the stack into the output
     Push the current operator onto the stack
   If it's a left bracket push it onto the stack
   If it's a right bracket: 
     While there's not a left bracket at the top of the stack:
       Pop operators from the stack into the output
     Pop the left bracket from the stack and discard it
 While there are operators on the stack pop them into the output
```
