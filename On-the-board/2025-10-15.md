## Some operators
### CAST operator (dynamic cast)
```sql
-- function-like syntax
select cast ('12345' as integer);
select cast ('2025-10-15' as date);
select cast ('12 45' as integer);

-- PostgreSQL-specific shorthand syntax (:: operator)
select '12345'::integer;
select '2025-10-15'::date;
```
If the left-hand argument operand can not be converted to the target type then an error occurs (the third example). 
> [!note]
> `::` operator precedence is very high. Use brackets.
> 
> You can create custom [types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html), [operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createoperator.html) and [casts](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createcast.html) in PostgreSQL  
 
> [!warning]
> Be <ins>very</ins> cautious with custom operators and casts. These may cause maintenance and compatibility issues  
 
### BETWEEN operator (boolean)
```sql
select <expression> between <lower_limit> and <upper_limit>;
-- is equivalent to 
select <expression> >= <lower_limit> and <expression> <= <upper_limit>;
-- i.e. inclusive of the limits' values
```
### IN operator (boolean)
```sql
select 5 in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7); --> true, equivalen to: 5 = 1 OR 5 = 2 OR ... OR 5 = 7
select 5 in (1,2,3,4,null);  --> poisoned, null
select 3 in (1,2,3,4,null);  --> true, the notable poison-immune exception since 3 = 3 is TRUE

select 5 in (1,2,3,4,null),
       5 not in (1,2,3,4,null); --> null, null
```
> [!note]
> Beware! Two opposite expressions yield the same result due to NULL poisoning!

### CASE operator, remotely similar to C ternary operator
```sql
-- case when <expr1> then <res1> [when <exprI> then <resI>]...[else <resE>] end
-- case <var> when <value1> then <res1> .... [else <resE>] end
-- case when <expr1> then <res1> end --> ELSE missing, yields NULL when <expr1> is FALSE

select case when 1 = 1 then 'Red' when 2 > 1 then 'Blue' else 'Green' end; --> yields 'Red'
```
### Regular expression match, no match, CI match, CI no match operators: `~, !~, ~*, !~*`
```sql
select 'Владимир' ~* '^вла.*$'; --> yields TRUE
```
> [!note]
> These operators are very powerful but expensive  
> They defeat indexes
